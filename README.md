Even though your browser understands a lot about colors, it doesnâ€™t offer much help in manipulating colors through JavaScript. The d3-color module therefore provides representations for various color spaces, allowing specification, conversion and manipulation. (Also see [d3-interpolate](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate) for color interpolation.)
